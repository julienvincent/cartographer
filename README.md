## Cartographer

A browser based utility for converting images into Minecraft map-art.

### Why

There are one or two existing versions of this out in the wild - [mapartcraft](https://rebane2001.com/mapartcraft/) for example - so why build another one?

+ Better interface for working with the given image
+ Ability to manually edit the generated map-art to tweak/fix things
+ Simpler, more direct output format (.schematic files) that don't need to be converted via third party tools
+ We were bored
